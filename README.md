### Group Members:
- Albert Salvesen-Orø
- Marcus Hagen

### §1 Weekly meetings
Weekly meetings are tentatively set to Wednesdays at 12:00. Though should all group members agree, this can be changed from one meeting to the next and should be considered somewhat flexible.
### §2 Consequences of tardiness
Being late once or twice will not result in any sanctions, being late 3 times will however result in the responsible group member having to do 1 additional hour of work on the project. A wiggle room of 15 minutes is allowed.

Sanction is one free beer to the other person after the project is finished.
### §3 Obligation to notify
The standard channel for communication is Discord, should a group member be sick or otherwise be unable to attend a meeting, a direct message in advance is sufficient. The message should be sent at least 1 hour in advance.
### §4 Conflict resolution
Any problem encountered should be approached in a “group vs the problem” as opposed to “group member vs group member”, with the aim to approach the said issue as objectively as possible. If this strategy should fail, one may approach an outside mediator for help.
### §5 Expected workload per group member
The standard expected amount of work per credit is 27 hours, and this project accounts for 4 credits, which means that the total workload per group member is 54 hours, give or take a few hours depending on progress.
